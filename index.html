    <p>
      <em><strong>Daryl.</strong></em> Daryl is one of the best characters in
      TWD. He had amazing character development and went from not even getting
      along with Rick to them becoming 'brothers' traveling alone for years
      after Rick disappeared to find him because he believed he is still alive.
      Daryl's fighting skills, tracking skills and loyalty to his friends made
      him one of the best and most useful charcaters in the walking dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Michonne.</strong></em> Michonne is an amazing character in
      TWD. She became a part of Ricks group in season 3 during their fight
      against <strong>'The Govenor'. </strong> Her combat skills, confidence,
      bravery and relationship with Carl easily won over everyone's heart
      including Carl and Rick's.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Glenn.</strong></em> Glenn is a fan favorite in TWD. His kind
      and bright personality was loved by everyone in Ricks group. Glenn made
      his first appearance in season 1 when he helped save Rick from the walkers
      in Atlanta. His speed, scavenging skills, and quick thinking made him a
      needed character in TWD.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Carl.</strong></em> Carl is a strong character in the walking
      dead. He is the son of Rick and he faced many battles at such a young age
      in TWD which made many viewers sympatized with him. In season 1 you see
      Carl as a bratty little boy but in Season 8 you see him a strong reliable
      young man who's a leader just like his father. His relationship with
      Michonne was really cool to see. They both used each other as comfort
      after Carl lost his mom and Michonne lost her son. Carl's good judgement,
      combat skills, courageousness and kind heart made him easily one of the
      best TWD characters
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Abraham.</strong></em> Abraham is a amazing TWD character.
      Abraham was the epitomy of bravery. When Abraham and the rest of Rick's
      team stood conered by the saviors and the BEST walking dead villain
      <strong>Negan</strong> he remained completely calm even right before his
      death. Abraham combat skills were amazing since he was a Sergeant in the
      U.S. Army before the apocolypse. His stubborness and hot headedness also
      made him a really funny character.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em><strong>Carol.</strong></em> Carol is easily one of the strongest
      female TWD characters. She came a very long way since season 1. In season
      1 Carol was being abused by her husband and did not have the confidence to
      stand up to him. Then her husband and daughter died and she wasn't sure
      what to do with her life. In later seasons we see Carol become better in
      combat and a reliable person in Ricks team. She became confident and was
      finally able to use her voice to stand up for herself and voice her
      opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>Maggie.</strong></em> Maggie was introduced in season 2 of TWD
      when Carl was shot and needed medical attention from her dad Hershel. At
      first Maggie seemed like a stuck up charcater because she was kind of cold
      to Glenn and the group But we later see how caring she is and how she just
      wanted her family to be protected. Maggie started off needing to be
      protected by Ricks group because she couldn't kill a mere walker to being
      known as <strong>The Widow.</strong> A woman who used her pain to fuel her
      strength and wanted to get revenge on <strong>Negan.</strong> She also
      became Hilltops leader.
